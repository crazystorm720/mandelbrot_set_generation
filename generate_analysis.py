The boundary of the Mandelbrot set is a fractal, and its visualization is a popular example of mathematical beauty in complex dynamics.\n\n")

This process is computationally intensive as it does not leverage vectorized operations.\n\n")

The same iterative function \\(f_c(z) = z^2 + c\\) is applied, but numpy arrays are used to handle multiple points simultaneously, thus optimizing the computation.\n\n")

        f.write("In terms of execution time, memory usage, and CPU utilization, the vectorized method outperforms the non-vectorized method. The non-vectorized method's simplicity comes at the cost of higher computational resources and longer execution times.\n\n")
